## 2026-06-15 — File Provider spike PROVEN end to end ✅

De-risked the riskiest part of the project before Phase 1. A real
`NSFileProviderReplicatedExtension` (SwiftPM, no Xcode project), serving a
static tree, is mounted and readable from Terminal:
`cd ~/Library/CloudStorage/WikiFS-WikiFS && find . && cat README.md && grep -R …`
all work. Full writeup + the five gotchas: `plans/file-provider.md`.

**Added (spike code — kept as the Phase 2 reference, serves static content):**
- `Sources/WikiFSFileProvider/` — extension (`FileProviderExtension`,
  `WikiFSEnumerator`, `WikiFSItem`, `Catalog`, `main.swift`).
- `Sources/WikiFS/FileProviderSpike.swift` + `WelcomeView.swift` — register the
  domain, resolve the user-visible path, reveal/copy it.
- `WikiFS/WikiFSFileProvider.entitlements`; second SwiftPM target in
  `Package.swift`; `build.sh` now assembles + inside-out-signs the `.appex`.

**Five gotchas solved (each cost time — see plans/file-provider.md):**
1. Entitlements must be ⊆ the profile — claiming `get-task-allow` (which these
   profiles lack) → AMFI SIGKILL at exec, no crash log.
2. Mach-O entry must be `_NSExtensionMain` via `-e` linker flag; a Swift
   `main()` calling `NSExtensionMain()` recurses → SIGSEGV.
3. Third-party File Provider must be user-enabled in System Settings (consent
   gate); `EnabledByDefault` doesn't bypass it.
4. App must be in `/Applications` + launched once for `pluginkit` discovery →
   dev loop is `make install`.
5. First codesign with a fresh cert needs a one-time keychain approval
   (errSecInternalComponent until then).

**Verified strings/tools:** mount at `~/Library/CloudStorage/WikiFS-WikiFS`;
`fileproviderctl dump` + `pluginkit -m` + `.ips` backtraces were the usable
diagnostics (sandboxed shell can't read the unified log).

## 2026-06-15 — Apple provisioning done up front (pre-Phase 2)

Per the user's call, knocked out the File Provider / App Group portal setup
*before* starting feature work, to de-risk Phase 2. Full detail + verified
strings in `plans/signing.md`.

- Apple Development cert installed: `Apple Development: Thomas Ptacek
  (7F2QE7P59D)` — already matches `DEV_IDENTITY` in the `Makefile`.
- This Mac registered as a dev device (`00006050-00190839016B401C`).
- App IDs created: `org.sockpuppet.WikiFS`, `org.sockpuppet.WikiFS.FileProvider`
  (both with App Groups capability).
- **App Group is `group.org.sockpuppet.wiki`** — NOT `…wikifs`. The `…wikifs`
  group got fouled up in the portal; adopted the working `…wiki` name rather
  than redo + regenerate profiles. Docs updated to match. DB will live at
  `~/Library/Group Containers/group.org.sockpuppet.wiki/WikiFS.sqlite`.
- Two macOS App Development profiles downloaded to `signing/` (gitignored),
  decoded + verified: team `KK7E9G89GW`, this device included, expire
  2027-06-15, authorize the exact entitlements recorded in `plans/signing.md`.
- Remaining signing work (embed profiles, inside-out codesign, `make install`
  loop) is wired in Phase 2.

## 2026-06-15 — Milestone 0: app skeleton on its legs

Bootstrapped the SwiftPM build environment from `Makefile.example` and got a
hello-world WikiFS SwiftUI app building, signing, and launching.

**Added**

- `Package.swift` — executable target `WikiFS`, macOS 14+, Swift tools 6.0.
- `Sources/WikiFS/WikiFSApp.swift` — `@main` App + `WindowGroup`.
- `Sources/WikiFS/ContentView.swift` — `NavigationSplitView` shell (foreshadows
  the sidebar/editor split).
- `Sources/WikiFS/WelcomeView.swift` — hello-world detail pane.
- `WikiFS/WikiFS.entitlements` — minimal (no sandbox yet).
- `scripts/make-icon.swift` — generates the app icon (white `books.vertical.fill`
  on a blue→indigo squircle) at all macOS sizes.
- `build.sh` — `swift build` → assemble `.app` → write `Info.plist` → codesign.
- `Makefile` — adapted from `Makefile.example` (Moves → WikiFS): app name,
  entitlements path, icon comment, notary profile `wikifs-notary`.
- `.gitignore` — `build/ .build/ dist/`.
- Docs: `PLAN.md` (index), `plans/build-environment.md` (build deep-dive).

**Verified**

- `make` builds `build/WikiFS.app` (debug, v0.0.0-dev). Dev cert not in this
  keychain → ad-hoc signature (expected; `make run` still works).
- `make check` compiles clean.
- Live gate (`SWIFTUI-RULES` §9.1): `make run` launches, window renders the
  native two-column layout with the books hero, process stays alive past the
  first display cycle. Screenshot confirmed the UI.

**Notes / decisions**

- Bundle id `org.sockpuppet.WikiFS`; min macOS 14 (matches `Makefile.example`).
- Ran the `swiftui-pro` skill on the sources (CLAUDE.md requirement). Only
  finding: one-type-per-file — extracted `WelcomeView` out of `ContentView.swift`.
- Toolchain present: Apple Swift 6.3.2, macOS 26.5 host.

**Next (Milestone 1 / setup)**

- Add a `WikiFSTests` target so `make test` does something.
- Begin SQLite store + page model (Milestone 0 deliverables in `plans/INITIAL.md`
  also include persistence; the build skeleton is done, the data layer is not).
